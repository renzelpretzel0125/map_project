//Still a Work in Progress, Hopefully finish by Thursday, made a lot of progress Friday,Saturday,Sunday, and Monday sorry for pushing dates further as I don't truly know when I can honestly finish this project as theres so many things needs implementing from design as I might be overthinking this. 
//Please email me back at rtgalvez@dons.usfca.edu when it'll be time to grade it and I'll still do my best. Thank you.
Revised and Final Design:
Reader Class:  
to read both csv files, that can be used to send into a linked list/adjacency list
Functions that I will use is:  
To get the  adjacency list
Buffered reader to read the file
Graph Class:
Used to create a graph for the cities 
To take the vertices and edges given from the csv files, read in Reader Class
Functions:
Graph
Add Cities
Remove Cities
Gets the Cities
Checks if there are cities
Attractions:
Establishes a hashtable to keep attractions and to which can be pulled out when looked for upon by user
Function:
Add
Get
Remove
Hashtable
Nodes for hashtable
ShortRoute:
Will incorporate and look over Djikstra’s algorithm to use the linked list in order to help find the shortest possible route.
Contains a City class to represent City/node in the graph.
The main function to run
Functions:
Recursive function to go back to the original route to find alternate paths
